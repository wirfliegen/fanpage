                <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
                    <h3>What is it about?</h3>
                        <p>This game is Xenoblade 2's prequel which takes place "500 years in the past." There are quotes around that last statement because the game technically takes place 1500+ years in the future if you think about it. The game focuses on Lora and the gang in their battles against Malos, whose goal is to destroy the world.</p>
                    <h3>So this is a prequel to Xenoblade Chronicles 2. Does the order in which you play the games matter?</h3>
                        <p>It doesn't really matter, but some of the events in this game will probably have a greater impact on you if you play Xenoblade 2 first.</p>
                    <h3>Will this game make me cry?</h3>
                        <p>Maybe. If you're a sissy like me then definitely.</p>
                    <h3>What are Drivers and Blades?</h3>
                        <p>Blades are basically sentient weapons.</p>
                    <h3>Who is your favorite character in this game?</h3>
                        <p>It's the Mega QT Haze lol</p>
                    <h3>The Twitter account you linked is Japanese. How do I read this?</h3>
                        <p>Good luck using Google Translate lmao</p>
                    <h3>Who is Skye Bennett and how is she relevant to this game?</h3>
                        <p>Skye is Mythra's voice actress! She's very active on social media and actually interacts with her fans! She also likes memes!! She also streamed a playthrough of Xenoblade 2 and recently started one for Torna!</p>
                    <h3>Has this game affected you?</h3>
                        <p>Heck yeah it has. I'm gonna name my future daughter Lora.</p>
                    <h3>This is a Xenoblade game. Does this mean that we'll see Shulk?</h3>
                        <p>No, Shulk is not in this game.</p>
                    <h3>Is Mòrag in this game?</h3>
                        <p>Sadly, no. She hasn't even been born yet.</p>
                    <h3>What are some other things I should know?</h3>
                        <p>Mythra and Malos are basically dysfunctional siblings.<br>
                            Lora and Jin are the Fire and Ice Power Couple™ of your dreams and they're happily married.<br>
                            Addam is a prince of Torna.
                        </p>
                    <h3>Where's Xenoblade 1?</h3>
                        <p>On the Wii, New Nintendo 3DS, and Wii U Virtual Console.</p>
                    <h3>Is the country really golden?</h3>
                        <p>Kind of? There are golden monsters if that counts.</p>
